Session description:
Can it be done? Should it be done?

This is a talk about creating an internet bank with editable content and integrations to banking systems. I will live code and talk about how to solve problems with simple design patterns, and how to avoid creating design monsters. I will share ideas about writing both testable and readable code, what to think about when validating user input and ways to handle dependencies to third party systems. Along the way I will also talk a bit about Pippi Longstocking and ways to manage placeholder banking data for EPiServer editors.
