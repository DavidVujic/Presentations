Test driven JavaScript?
========

Write a simple test, write a simple function. Done.

Okay, that was the twitter version.

The presentation version will focus on how test driven development can be done with JavaScript and 
I will try to write the code with simplicity in mind, i.e. avoid the common JavaScript language gotchas, 
like prototype inheritance and pseudo classes with the ”new” or ”this” keywords. 

In this presentation I will use only one tool for unit testing (QUnit).
